# 🔋 EV Adoption & Charging Demand Forecasting

This project aims to predict the future adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and estimate corresponding charging demand using historical data and machine learning techniques. The insights can assist in infrastructure planning, policy-making, and supporting EV ecosystem development.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Forecast EV vehicle adoption over time.
- Estimate charging station demand based on adoption trends.
- Visualize trends and model accuracy for better understanding.
- Help support sustainable energy and transportation goals.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Regression Modeling** (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost)
- **Time Series Forecasting** (optional depending on your notebook)
- **Performance Metrics**: R² Score, MAE, RMSE

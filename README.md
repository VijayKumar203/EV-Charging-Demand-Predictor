# EV Charging Demand Predictor 🚗⚡

This repository contains a Machine Learning-based solution to predict Electric Vehicle (EV) demand using historical vehicle registration data and other relevant features. The project is organized into two phases (Week 1 and Week 2), covering data analysis, preprocessing, model development, and result visualization.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- **Week 1**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and initial model building.
- **Week 2**: Model tuning, performance evaluation, and visualizations.
  
## 📊 Project Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates the number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using features such as total vehicles, non-electric vehicles, year, and location (county).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## 🔍 Key Features

- Data cleaning and type conversions
- Label encoding of categorical variables
- Model training using XGBoost
- Performance metrics: MAE, R² Score
- Visualizations for insights

## 📈 Final Outcome

A model capable of predicting EV adoption trends with a focus on supporting EV infrastructure planning.

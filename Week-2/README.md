# Week 2: Model Optimization & Visualization 📊

## ✅ Tasks Completed

- Continued model development using `XGBRegressor`.
- Cleaned and transformed numerical columns (`Total Vehicles`, `Non-Electric Vehicle Total`) by removing commas and converting them to numeric values.
- Visualized key insights such as:
  - EV trends over the years
  - Comparison between EV and Non-EV counts
  - County-wise EV distribution (using bar plots or scatter plots)

## 📈 Added Graphs

Graphs were generated using:
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `seaborn`

These visualizations help in understanding:
- EV adoption growth trends
- The correlation between features and EV count
- County-wise differences in EV demand

## ⚙️ Final Model Performance

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: [Add updated score]
- **R² Score**: [Add updated score]

## 📊 Final Output

Successfully built a predictive model that supports EV demand forecasting with relevant visual analytics for decision-makers.
